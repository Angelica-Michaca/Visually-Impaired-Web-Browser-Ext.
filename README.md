# Visually-Impaired-Web-Browser-Ext.
This  web browser extension will allow users to point at or select content and have it read aloud to them. 
They will also be able to have the content read to them word by word. It will be our first experience with a project that isnâ€™t about making content accessible directly, but rather about building something that changes existing content to make it more accessible. In other words, this will be my first access technology!
